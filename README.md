  ## Description

  This project was to build a CMS that could be invoked from the command line, allowing users to access and interact with an employee database.

  ## Installation

  Simply run "npm install" from the root directory.

  ## Usage

  Once you have installed the project, make sure you are in the root directory, then type "npm start" into the command line and make your selections! If you would like to use the example database used in the demo, run mysql and type in source "db/db.sql", "source db/schema.sql", and finally, "source db/seeds.sql".
